# NewsML-G2 Guidelines in HTML

The IPTC NewsML-G2 Guidelines were published as PDF files since the first
release in 2009. As many users showed interest in the guidelines as a web
document, the NewsML-G2 Working Group transformed the PDF Guidelines document
to HTML.

The updated web version of the Guidelines are published now at:
[https://www.iptc.org/std/NewsML-G2/guidelines](https://www.iptc.org/std/NewsML-G2/guidelines)

Please check this URL, it shows the full Guidelines with all Quick Start
variants for Text, Photo, Video and Packages integrated into one documentation
package.
