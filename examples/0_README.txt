Note about the examples
=======================

This set of NewsML-G2 examples is based on version 2.25 for the Power Level
and on 2.24 for the Core Level (which is not upgraded any further, 
see http://dev.iptc.org/G2-Standards)

The NewsML-G2 examples are updated once a year, not for each new version. 
As the latest NewsML-G2 versions don't set essential changes and
primarily additions the files in this folder are highly usable  
to this version of the standard too.
